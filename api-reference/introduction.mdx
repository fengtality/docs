The Hummingbot API provides a comprehensive RESTful interface for managing trading operations across multiple exchanges. This reference documents all available endpoints, organized by functional area.

## Base URL

```
http://localhost:8000
```

For cloud deployments, replace `localhost` with your server's IP address or domain.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require HTTP Basic Authentication. Include your credentials in every request:

```bash
curl -u username:password http://localhost:8000/endpoint
```

Or using the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'username:password' | base64)" \
  http://localhost:8000/endpoint
```

Configure your username and password during setup or update them in the `.env` file.
