<Info>
Condor Dashboard is currently under development and will be available soon.
</Info>

Condor Dashboard is a modern, browser-based interface for managing trading bots powered by Hummingbot. It syncs with [Condor Telegram](/docs/condor/overview) for mobile monitoring and control.

Condor Dashboard is intended as a replacement for the legacy [Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), rebuilt from the ground up to work with Hummingbot API.
