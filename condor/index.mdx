## Architecture

Condor acts as a secure bridge between your Hummingbot instances and the Telegram platform. It translates user commands from Telegram into API requests that your Hummingbot instances understand.

```

     ├─→ Hummingbot API → Trading Bots
     ├─→ Gateway → DEX Protocols (Uniswap, Jupiter, etc.)

```

### Core Components

1. **Telegram Interface**: The user-facing component running on Telegram clients, handling user input and displaying interactive menus.
2. **Command Handlers**: The logic layer that processes specific commands (e.g., `/portfolio`, `/bots`) and determines the appropriate action.
3. **API Integration Layer**: A secure communication module that interacts with the Hummingbot API using standard REST protocols.
4. **Data Processing Utilities**: Helper functions that format raw data from Hummingbot into clear, readable messages and visualizations.

## Why Use Condor?

- **Accessibility**: Manage your bots on the go without needing SSH access or complex terminal commands.
- **Simplicity**: Abstract away technical complexities with intuitive menus and buttons.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly react to market changes by managing positions and bots instantly.
